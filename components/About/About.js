                First of all, my name is Tudor Alexandru - Ionut and I am from Rom√¢nia, my passion for Web Development started in July 2019. I started with HTML5 and I didn&apos;t know so much about this, but I chose the Front-End field because I want to show the world what I can do with a computer. 
                And now I am doing freelancing and living a good life by connecting with people around the world.

                        <p>After a few months I knew that I am good at what I&apos;m doing, actually, from the first page that I made at that time I knew that I can do much better. I wasn&apos;t like others at start, put some text and add a color and that&apos;s it, even though I didn&apos;t had the knowledge at that time to make something bigger, like animations or working with libraries, and I don&apos;t like to lie myself about my work, I want to make the things perfectly and I think I have a special eye for details.</p>
